# Citibike Trip Data Analysis

Hello! This folder contains the files and notebooks that were used to conduct the EDA on Citibikes

Most of the files are in Jupyter notebooks, so opening them in VSCode should not be an issue.

For Citibikes_EDA.pbix, you do need to install Power BI Desktop to open the file as it's the only software that can open this file.
However, I have also placed the images of the charts generated in PowerBI into the PowerBI_Charts.ipynb notebook, so you can refer to that as well!
