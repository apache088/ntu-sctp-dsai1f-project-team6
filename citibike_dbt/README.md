# Citibike Trip Data Transformation

## Feature Engineering

Synopsis: This section explains how new features were created or selected to improve model performance.  

| S/N | Table | New Feature(s) | Implementation Logic | Key Benefit(s)
| --- | ----- | -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------
| 1 | `fact_trip` | `duration_mins` | Computing difference between start and end times | Key metric used for analysis; no additional computation is required during analysis
| 2 | `fact_trip` | `distance_metres` | Using BigQueryâ€™s functions (`ST_DISTANCE`, `ST_GEOPOINT`) | Can be used to estimate the trip distance
| 3 | `fact_trip` | `price_paid` | Referencing `price_plans` seed table to compute price paid per trip | Key metric to determine revenue impact by stations; no additional computation is required during analysis
| 4 | `dim_stations` | Every station as an unique record | Using CTE to combine all start and end stations into a temp table and group them by four columns to uniquely identify every station | Normalised data facilitates analysis at per station level
| 5 | `dim_stations` | `total_starts`, `total_ends` | Using a temp column to store roles of every station and counting how many times each station is used as the start station for trips, likewise for end station | Useful indicators to quickly identify most used or least used stations

## Model Development

Synopsis: This section documents the models built, algorithms used, and rationale for their selection.  

There are four models built (excluding the `price_plans` seed table which contains static/reference data): *`fact_trips`, `dim_stations`, `dim_membership_types`, `dim_bike_types`*.

All models are built based on the source dataset, with new features added as per described in the preceding section. Full implementation logic is shown in the following code snippets.  

As the source dataset does have incomplete data, several implementation techniques are applied to mitigate errors during execution of the data pipeline.

\
Defensive coding (applicable to all tables)  
- Explicit casting to mitigate inference differences between `dbt` and BigQuery  
- Using `COALESCE` function to mitigate errors due to missing/null values  
- Using common environment variables by implementing `python-dotenv`  

\
Data quality (applicable to `dim_stations` table)  
- Generating primary key based on four columns to mitigate incomplete source data which can give rise to downstream discrepancies (e.g., distance computation with null or zero results)
